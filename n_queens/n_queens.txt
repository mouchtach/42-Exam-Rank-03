Chess composer Max Bezzel published the eight queens puzzle in 1848. Franz
Nauck published the first solutions in 1850. Nauck also extended the puzzle to
the n queens problem, with n queens on a chessboard of nXn squares.

This is how Nauck describe the problem:

The Eight Queens Problem.
One of the classical problems connected with a chess-board is the determination
of the number of ways in which eight queens can be placed on a chess-board, or
more generally, in which n queens can be placed on a board of nÂ² cells so that
no queen can take any other.
